“Salmonella: How Bacteria Make You Sick”
🌟 1️⃣ HERO / INTRODUCTION SECTION

Purpose: Introduce the topic and your group.
Include:

Title of project: Salmonella — How Bacteria Make You Sick

Subtitle: Group 4 — GCSE Biology Presentation

A short summary (1–2 sentences) of what the website will cover: how Salmonella spreads, symptoms, prevention, and links to other groups.

A visual background (microscope, bacteria, food, etc.)

A “Scroll to Begin ↓” animation or button.

🌿 2️⃣ FROM PLANTS TO PEOPLE (LINK TO GROUP 3)

Purpose: Connect your disease to the previous group (TMV).
Include:

Quick summary of TMV (plant virus, damages leaves, stops photosynthesis).

Explanation that your group moves from viruses → bacteria and plants → humans.

Difference between virus and bacterium (virus not living, bacterium is alive).

Small comparison chart or info box showing TMV vs Salmonella.

🧬 3️⃣ WHAT ARE PATHOGENS?

Purpose: Give background info before focusing on your disease.
Include:

Definition of “pathogen.”

The four main types: bacteria, viruses, fungi, protists.

Short examples for each (Salmonella, Measles, Rose Black Spot, Malaria).

Quick sentence about how they cause disease (cell damage or toxin release).

Simple diagram or icons for each pathogen type.

🍗 4️⃣ WHAT IS SALMONELLA?

Purpose: Introduce your specific pathogen.
Include:

Type of pathogen (bacterium).

Who discovered it (Dr Daniel Salmon, 1885).

Where it’s found (raw meat, eggs, dairy).

How it looks (rod-shaped, has flagella).

Fact: over 2,500 types (serotypes).

Short note that it infects the intestines and releases toxins.

Maybe include a “quick facts” box (type, host, shape, danger level).

🌍 5️⃣ HOW IT SPREADS

Purpose: Explain transmission and causes.
Include:

How Salmonella gets into food (contaminated poultry, eggs, milk).

How it spreads between people (poor hygiene, dirty surfaces, not washing hands).

Timeline or diagram: Farm → Chicken → Kitchen → Plate → Person.

Note that UK poultry are vaccinated to stop spread.

List of prevention steps (cook, clean, chill, separate).

⚗️ 6️⃣ HOW IT CAUSES DISEASE (MECHANISM)

Purpose: Explain what happens inside the body.
Include:

How bacteria enter (by eating contaminated food).

How they attach to gut walls and reproduce.

What toxins do (damage cells, irritate intestines).

How the immune system responds (fever, inflammation).

Incubation period (8–72 hours).

Optional: step-by-step flowchart or animation.

🤒 7️⃣ SYMPTOMS

Purpose: Describe effects of infection.
Include:

Common symptoms: fever, cramps, vomiting, diarrhoea.

Why each happens (immune response, toxins, inflammation).

Duration of symptoms (2–7 days).

Note on dehydration risk and who’s most at risk (children, elderly).

Visuals: icons or animated symbols for each symptom.

💊 8️⃣ PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

Purpose: Explain how infection can be avoided or treated.
Include:

Hygiene steps: cooking food properly, handwashing, separating raw/cooked food, refrigerating leftovers.

Poultry vaccination (in UK).

Treatment info: most people recover naturally; antibiotics only for severe cases.

Simple “Do / Don’t” box (e.g. ✅ Wash hands / ❌ Eat raw egg).

Add image or hover icons (soap, fridge, chicken, thermometer).

📚 9️⃣ AQA SPECIFICATION SUMMARY

Purpose: Show what you need to know for GCSE.
Include:

Official AQA learning points:

Salmonella causes food poisoning.

Symptoms caused by toxins.

Spread through contaminated food.

Prevention through vaccination and hygiene.

Add one example exam-style question or fact highlight.

Hover glossary for key words like “toxin”, “vector”, “bacterium”.

🧩 🔟 INTERACTIVE GAME — “INFECT OR PROTECT”

Purpose: Make the website interactive and educational.
Game format: A decision-making game where the user makes hygiene choices.
Include:

Scenario 1 — In the Kitchen

You’re cooking raw chicken — what do you do first?

(Options: Wash hands / Cut vegetables / Taste sauce)

Add reactions for right/wrong choices.

Scenario 2 — Cooking Time

Chicken looks cooked outside, but not sure inside — what next?

(Options: Check with thermometer / Serve now / Microwave quickly)

Scenario 3 — Storage Time

You have leftovers — what do you do?

(Options: Put in fridge / Leave out / Reuse same plate)

Each correct answer → bacteria defeated / outbreak stopped.
Each wrong answer → bacteria spread.
Add results screen: “You stopped the outbreak!” or “Bacteria won this round!”

🌎 11️⃣ GLOBAL IMPACT

Purpose: Show real-world scale of the problem.
Include:

Annual infections: around 90 million globally.

Where it’s most common (areas with poor refrigeration or sanitation).

Example outbreak (e.g. contaminated eggs).

How better food safety laws reduce cases.

Add a glowing world map or infection spread animation.
